# SMTP_BulkMail </br>
This code script is written by @recberdeniz to exercise about python GUI application for Python Programming
Before using a GUI you should check your mail provider options that could allow less secure app access
I used hotmail/outlook mail provider and the process succeed I have also tried to send a mail with my gmail,
but google could not allow that less secure app access.
Receiver mail addresses should split with ",". For example; username@gmail.com, testmail@hotmail.com,...
